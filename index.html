        <p>
          I am an adpoted Kiwi, having immigrated here from South Africa many years ago. I feel truly blessed to be here. I have a wonderful husband and two gorgeous sons - men who have filled my life and made me laugh (and cry).  I am incredibly proud of all three.  Living in Palmerston North, I have found loyal friends and work collegues and a place to call home.
        </p>
        <p>While no-ones life is ever without it's challenges, when I look back with gratitude, it is the joys and the victories that stand out in sharp focus and the hard time are just a blur.
