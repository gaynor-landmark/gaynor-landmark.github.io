              <p>
                Sometimes simple problems are the hardest to resolve.  Their cause is never obvious (or it wouldn't be a problem) but my brain seems to want to look for the cause in the area where I am least confident in the code I have written.  As a result, I usually over look what appears to be an insignificant detail.
              </p>
              <li>What problem solving techniques did you use?</li>
              <p>
                Eventually, when I start being methodical about the cause of a problem (instead of jumping to conclusions), the first place to look is for error messages.  Once all the syntax is clean, the problem might have "magically" gone away.  If not, now is the time to go systematically through your logic, using consol.log() to check what is going into and coming out of functions and then deeper into cde blocks, until the mistake is found.

                When you are going throught the process, you are sure that you must have a MAJOR problem!  It never feels small.

                I'd like to think that all my solutions are elegant, but tht probably isn't true.  However, most solutions can be  made more elegant with a bit of effort once they are working.
              </p>
              <li>What problem solving techniques did you use?</li>
              <p>
                I think that an elegant solution needs refinement.

              <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
              <p>
                If you want to have an elegant solution, you can't be satisfied with just good enough.
              </p>
              <li>What did you learn?</li> 
              <p>
                The elegant solutions are the SIMPLE solutions rather than the ones that look complex and clever.

                I love Psuedocode - or at least my brand of it! It saves on documentation later too.

                I'm happy to try something if I know it is heading in the right direction, but I definitely wouldn't start here.

              <p>
                I just feel stupid talking to no-one, but explaining my problem to someone else who might or might not ask relevant questions will often send me off in the right direction inadvertently.

              <li>Reading error messages</li> 
              <p>
                New languages mean new unreadable error messages, but they are still worth trying to pick up some clues from, and eventually they will start to make sense.

              <li>Console.logging</li>

                This is easy and good value for the little effort it is to use.

              <p>
                I'm not usually afraid to look stupid in front of my peers, but I try to make a good impression first while they are getting to know me before I go and spoil it all.
              </p>
              <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
              <p>
                The coaches are very helpful, but I think that it is a bit cheeky to ask for help if you haven't actually tried all of the above.  I know it is best to put a bit of effort in first or I will not learn as much.  It is always nice to be reassured that at least I am on the right track.
              </p>
              <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
              <p>
                This is something I can work on.  I am always rushing off to the next thing on the list.  I had not realised how useful reflection can be in learning.

            <h2>Describe what these functions do:</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="ten columns"> 
            <p>
              These functions are little pieces of code that do something to, or with the items in a list, better known as an array.
            </p>
            <ul> 
              <li>.map()</li>
              <p>
                'map' will work its way through each item on the list, in order, transforming that item, using the instructions that have been handed to it, and then using that item to create a new transformed list.  For example, the list (array) could contain the names of the children in a family. This might be shown as ["john", "jack", "jill"]. 'map' could be used to take each name in turn and capitalise the first letter or add their surname. The 'transformation' to be done would vary each time. The new list (array) could look like something like this - ["John Smith", "Jack Smith", "Jill Smith" ].  All the items that were in the initial list still appear in the second list. 
              </p>
              <li>.filter()</li>
              <p>
                'filter' works it way through each item, in order, in the same way that 'map' does.  However, instead of transforming each item, the logic that is applied to each is used to decide whether or not that item should appear in the new array.  For example, given the list that had just been transformed using 'map', Jack Smith' might be filtered out and the whole new list or array would be filtered down to ["John Smith", "Jill Smith" ]. 
              </p>
              <li>.reduce()</li>
              <p>
                'reduce' is a similar but now flexible tool used for transforming arrays.  It also works it's way through each item in the list in order, but it gathers the information on the way. Each time it moves on to a new item, it still has the result of what was created after dealing with the previous item. For example, 'reduce' can be used to find the total of a list of numbers. if this is the original array - [10,20,30], and the total starts with a value of 0, then working from the first item, 0 + 10 = 10.  Total is now 10.  Now adding the second item, 10 + 20 gives a new Total of 30. On to the last item, 30 + 30 = 60.  The Total is 60.  This is not the only way 'reduce' can be used. It can be used to create a total or an  array or even a new object.

            <h2>How does recursion compare with iteration:</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="ten columns"> 
            <p>
              Both 'recursion' and 'iteration' will repeat a process (block of code) until a condition is met that will stop it repeating, getting closer to the required result each time the repeat occurs.  'Iteration' will generally use a loop in the code within a function, to perform the repetition.  'Recursion' occurs when the whole function performing the process repeats by calling itself (starting itself) again. When using 'iteration' there will be only one call on the stack for the function that the loop is found in, but for 'iteration', a new call is added to the stack each time the function calls itself, without the previous function having completed and being removed from the stack.  In both cases errors could occur.  Recursion can run out of room on the stack and iteration can cause CPU errors, especially if the exit condition is never reached.  Recursion is slower that iteration but is useful when traversing tree structures.  Iterative code is generally lenghtier than recursive code.
