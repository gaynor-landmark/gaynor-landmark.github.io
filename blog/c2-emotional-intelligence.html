        <h2>Did you connect with any of the analogies for the mind?</h2>
        <p>I like the idea of the flagpole with the fluttering flag.  The flagpole represents mindfulness, while the flag represents the mind.  The emotions cause the flag to flutter.  The stronger the emotions, the more the mind will 'flutter'. The 'flagpole' of mindfulness keeps the mind in one place - attached and constant.</p>
        <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
        <p>Studies have shown that journaling is a useful technique for dealing with negative emotions.  I think that I want to try this.  It appears that even a short amount of time spent journaling can aid significantly in processing lifes ups and downs.</p>
        <h2>How did you find the body scanning?</h2>
        <p>I'm not too sure how I feel about body scanning.  I do know that it can help me to fall asleep. It seems to work better than counting sheep!</p>
