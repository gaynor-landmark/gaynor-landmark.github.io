        <h2>Reflections on the EDA Experience</h2>
        <h3>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience? </h3>
        <p>
          This is a very special opportunity for me.  It seemed that the river of my life was flowing along at a very sedate pace, when suddenly, there was a bend in the river, and around that corner were some very unexpected rapids.  I had a choice to either paddle to the side and stay in the shallows or start paddling and face the challenge.  I have chosen to head out to deeper water (turning down a safe and boring job) and start paddling furiously towards the EDA rapids and hopefully a new adventure beyond. 
        </p>
        <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
        <p>
          At this stage, still in Phase-0, I am expecting hard work, but an opening up to new ideas, technology and creativity.
        </p>
        <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
        <p>
          I feel like I have both a restaurant mindset and a kitchen mindset.  I think that I am investing a lot of money in this course, and expect to get a lot out, but because of that, I am prepared to roll up my sleeves and throw myself into the work.
        </p>
        <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
        <p>
          I was told it would be a big time commitment, and I still believe it will be, but now I think that the support will also be awesome.
        </p>
        <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
        <p>
          Very excited and very nervous!!!
