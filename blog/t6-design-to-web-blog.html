              <h2>What is a responsive site and why is it important?</h2>
              <p>  
                Responsive sites are sites that are designed to create an optimal experience for the user, no-matter what type of device they are using.  This is important as screen resolution varies considerably across devices.  A responsive site will change to accommodate the change in available space.  A responsive site should be easy to read and navigate with a minimum amount of scrolling anf re-sizing.  Generally the content would be the same, but in some cases a smaller screen may have simpler content while a larger screen might show a more fully featured version.     
              </p>
              <h2>What is mobile first, and why is it important?</h2>
              <p>   
                'Mobile first' is a design philosophy where the designer will start by designing the simpler mobile version of the site, to ensure that this is slick and efficient, and then move on to the design for larger screens, as opposed to first designing the full-sized version of the site and the progressively "degrading" the site until it works well on a mobile device with a small screen. This is believed to be a better way of designing as the designer is forced to consider what is really important to include in a mobile version, rather than just including everything as there is plenty of space.  This sh ould produce a better hierachy of the content.

                Of course, it should be possible to start from either end and still do each properly and with the correct attention to the usability on a variety of screen sizes.  Maybe the real problem here is that due to time and budget constraints, there will always be a compromise

              <h2>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h2>
              <p>   
                A framework is a collection of CSS classes that make a page layout design easier to implement.  The framework supplies many of the building blocks for styles and helper-classes to easliy create the design.
              </p>
              <h3>Pros</h3> 
              <ul>
                <li>much quicker to develop as a lot of the work has already been done</li>
                <li>the code should be well-written and throughly tested</li>
                <li>cross-browser issues should be handled by the framework, so your site should look good on all browsers</li>
                <li>it will encourage consistency accross your site</li>
                <li>there are plenty of frameworks to choose from, so there should be one suitable for most uses</li>
              </ul>  
              <h3>Cons</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>a framework can be complex to use</li>
                <li>using a framework could mean loading a lot of CSS that is never used</li> 
                <li>less flexible that hand-written CSS</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>What is a wireframe is and why would we use one?</h2>
              <p>   
                A wireframe is a graphical representation of a page layout or the GUI, and the way that a user or visitor to a site will interact with it. The placement of content is shown, and how the user will navigate around the site.      
              </p>
              <h2>What aspects of my wireframes were difficult to implement, and why?</h2>
              <p>   
                 There were lots of little things that I found frustrating as they all needed Javascript to implement.  As this was not part of this weeks assignment, I made a number of changes to my design (3 to 4 revisions) to simplify it and still make it easy to navigate.
