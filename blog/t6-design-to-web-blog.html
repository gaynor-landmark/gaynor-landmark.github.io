              <h2>What aspects of my wireframes were difficult to implement, and why?</h2>
              <p>   
                 There were lots of little things that I found frustrating as they all needed Javascript to implement.  As this was not part of this weeks assignment, I made a number of changes to my design (3 to 4 revisions) to simplify it and still make it easy to navigate.
