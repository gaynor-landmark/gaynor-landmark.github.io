              I'm going to try the Pomodoro Technique today.  Having done some reading about it, I'm
              wondering if taking more frequent breaks than I usually do will make me more productive.
                I have always believed that it takes 15 minutes for a developer to get into 'the zone',
                so this will be interesting to try.

              <q>In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.</q><em> Carol Dweck</em>

              This is interesting. I have loved reading about how one can develop a growth-mindset through
               displaying one's ability.  To quote the author, <em>James Clear</em> and his coach -
              <q>...starting small, proving your ability to yourself in a thousand tiny ways, and letting the
                confidence and growth mindset naturally follow from there. Confidence is just displayed
                ability.</q>

            <p>
              I love the idea that tiny habits can change a life.  It is definitely an idea that I will try.
                It seems that small things can easily make a person dissatisfied and miserable, so then
                small positive changes could make a major improvement to their happiness and contentment.
