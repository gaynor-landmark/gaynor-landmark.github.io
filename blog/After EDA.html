              My head is still spinning! It was an intensive 9 weeks, in a focused immersive environment, designed to encourage accelerated learning.
              The course pushed me beyond what I thought I was capable of, while
              supporting my learning in practical ways. There was both theoretical and practical learning,
              with lots of pair-programming and group project experience.

              What did I get out if it?  Well, apart from the obvious technical skills, and some life-long friends, I
               re-discovered my love of programming.  After working for one company for a number of years, it was
               so refreshing to learn new ways of doing things and spend time discovering new technolgies.
               I was greedy to learn and I encouraged to endulge myself!
