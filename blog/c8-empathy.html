              I felt OK.  According to the chapter, I believe that most people feel happy. I was feeling relaxed and happy when I started reading the chapter, but by the end, I was also feeling a little irritated.  I felt like I had been playing a game and that I was being insincere.

              This one felt even more insincere because I don't naturally talk that way.  It felt very false to me.

              I would describe a place where I worked in the past, as dysfunctional in exactly the way that was described in this chapter.  Of course this led to some interesting situations!  There were some meetings in which some people just sa there, and did not talk at all.  They admitted to me later that they believed that they did have a contribution to make, but that they were tired of their ideas, and issues being ignored by Management.  Obviously this was not particularly useful, so a LOT of empathetic listening was required.  This did lead to an increase of trust within the team who grew to lean on each other more. Unfortunately, Management just never 'got it' and in certain respects, the team remained dysfuntional.

            <h2>Give an example of "person praise" and "process praise"</h2>

              This is the sort of thing that every parent knows.  As parents we give both 'person' and 'process' praise.  I told my sons how awesome and wonderful and talented and unique they were constantly, as they were growing up.  They needed to know that they had been given special talents and that they should put them to good use.  This was the 'person' praise and it did build confidence in them.  However, they did have their weak points to, so they also got process praise based on motivation and effort.  They were praised when they tidied their rooms or made an effort to help around the house without being asked, even if the job wasn't perfect.  This was the 'process' praise.  (Mostly the process praise came after a lot of correction and encouragement.) Their senior school motto (very sucessfully drummed into them by the masters) was "Nothing achieved without hard work" - something we could all live by.  Talent alone is just not going to cut it!
