              I felt OK.  I believe I  was supposed to be happy, but although I was feeling relaxed and happy (like I was before I started reading this chapter), I was also feelig a little irritated.  I fely like I had been playing a game and that I was bing insincere.

              This one felt even more insincere because I don't naturally talk that way.  It felt false to me.

              I would describe a preious place of employment as dysfunctional in exactly the way that was described in this chapter.  Of course this led to some interesting situations!  There were some in meetings in which some attendees did not talk at all.  They admitted to me that they did have things to contribute, but that they were tired of their ideas, and issues being ignored by management.  Obviously this was not particularly useful, so a LOT of empathetic listening was required.  This did lead to an increase of trust within the team who grew to lean on each other more. Unfortunately, Management just never 'got it' and in certain respects, the team remained dysfuntional.

              This is the sort of thing that every parent need to learn to do.  As parents we give both 'person' and 'process' praise.  I told my sons how awesome and wonderful and talented and unique they were constantly as they were growing up.  They needed to know that they had been given special talents and how to put them to good use.  This was the 'person' praise.  However, they did have their weak points to, so they also got process praise based on motivation and effort.  They were praised when they tidied their rooms or made an effort to help around the house without being asked, even if the job wasn't perfect  This was the 'process' praise.  (Mostly the process praise came after a lot of correction and encouragement.)
