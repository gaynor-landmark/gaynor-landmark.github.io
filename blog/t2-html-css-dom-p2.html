        <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
        <p>
          Grid-based design is a way of dividing up the web page into sections using CSS, so that a page can be styled to have 2 equal columns, 3 equal columns, 4 equal columns or columns of varying widths, without using fixed pixel widths.
        </p>
        <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
        <p>
            Responsive webpages are now very important because of the huge variety of devices, with different resolutions, that will be used to access each webpage.  A responsive webpage responds to its environment, changing its layout based on the width of the browser window as it is rendered.  There is no need to specify a particular layout based on the width of the browser window, as the page re-adjusts the size of each section on the fly. Because of this, awkward scrolling should be avoided.
        </p>  
        <h2>Semantic structure</h2>
        <p>
            Semantic Structure is the organization of the page that gives it meaning. Once a mockup has been boxified and the structure has been established, the semantic tags give the structure meaning. For example, the h1 to h6 tags indicate the hierarchy of the titles on the page.  An h2 heading indicates that it is a sub-heading of the h1 heading.       
        </p>  
        <h2>And while I'm thinking about it...</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            White space is important for clarity on the page and should be considered as an important design element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overflow (overflow: auto) is useful when a large amount of text needs to be fitted into a small area.  This gives the box a scroll bar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Code -> Test -> Refine ->Code .... is a good pattern for working.
          </li>
