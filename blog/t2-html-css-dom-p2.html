        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
        <p>
            Grid-based design is a way of dividing up the web page into sections using CSS, so that a page can be styled to have 2 equal columns, 3 equal columns, 4 equal columns or columns of varying widths, without using fixed pixel widths.
        </p>
        <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
        <p>
            Responsive webpages are now very important because of the huge variety of devices, with different resolutions, that will be used to access each webpage.  A responsive webpage changes its layout based on the width of the browser window as it is rendered.  There is no need to specify a particular layout based on the width of the browser window, as the page re-adjusts the size of each section on the fly.
