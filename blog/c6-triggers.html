            <h2>Developing Self-Mastery - From Compulsion to Choice</h2>
            <h2>How did the trigger training exercises feel?</h2>
            <p>   
              This could be a useful technique - but I would probably adopt it to fit more with my beliefs and the way I like to live my life.  
              I know that I am not very good at 'letting go' when something has upset me or I feel strongly about an issue. I also know that I am very good at 'feeding the monsters'.  I think that the suggestion to stop and then breathe (pausing) before responding in an unconsidered way is very sensible. Cosidering each issue from the other person'point of view is important in order to move on and 'let go'. 
            </p>
            <h2>Did you notice any responses in yourself?</h2>
            <p>   
              I get distracted and my thoughts tend to race and go all over the place when I am 'triggered'.     
            </p>
            <h2>
              What emotion do you want to befriend?  
            </h2>
            <p>   
              I'm really not interested in befriending any negative emotion.  I prefer to concentrate on other things that are good and wholesome and lovely instead.  Gratitude is what I am working on right now.  My current power thougth is - "I live in the present and enjoy every moment".
