              I'm going to try the Pomodoro Technique today.  It recommends more frequent breaks that I am used to taking.  I have always believed that it takes 15 minutes for a developer to get into 'the zone', so this will be interesting to try.

              <q>In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.</q><em> Carol Dweck</em>

              I loved reading about how one can develop a growth-mindset through displaying one's ability.  To quote the author, <em>James Clear</em> and his coach -
              <q>...starting small, proving your ability to yourself in a thousand tiny ways, and letting the confidence and growth mindset naturally follow from there. Confidence is just displayed ability.</q>

              I have used timeboxing in the past to attempt to get a decision out of a meeting without it dragging on and on and on.  It works well if the facilitator keeps the discussion on task and there is a clock on the wall!

              I loved the idea of tiny habits changing a life.  It is definitely an idea that I will try.  It seems that small things can easily make a person dissatisfied and miserable, so then small positive changes could make a major improvement to their happiness and contentment.
