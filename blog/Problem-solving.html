            <h3>Improving process with reflection</h3>
            <p>
              This is something I plan to work on.  I am always rushing off to the next thing
               on the list.  I'm beginning to realise that reflection is a useful tool for improving learning.

            <p>
              A problem is never simple or small until it is resolved, and sometimes simple problems are the hardest to resolve.  Their cause is never obvious and my brain seems to want to look for the cause in the area where I am least confident in the code I have written.
              It is so easy to over-look the real issue just because it appears to be a small and insignificant detail.
              <br>
              Instead of jumping to conclusions, the first place to look is for error messages.
              Once all the syntax is clean, it is amazing how often the problem has "magically" gone away.
              If not, then its time to go systematically through the logic, check the 'seams'.  What is going into this function? And what is coming out?
              Then it is time to go deeper into code blocks, until the bug is found and the problem solved.
              <br>
              Its amazing how often a 'MAJOR PROBLEM' turns out to be a spelling mistake!
              <br>
              What do I need to remember?
              <br>
              Read the error messages!!!!! New languages mean new unreadable error messages, but they are still worth trying to pick up some clues from, and eventually they will start to make sense.

              An elegant solution usually needs refinement.
              If you want to have an elegant solution, you can't be satisfied with just good enough.
              The elegant solutions are the SIMPLE solutions rather than the ones that look complex
              and clever.
              Complex and clever will sooner or later become someone's nightmare!
              <br>
              Google - We are so fortunate to have such resources at our finger-tips now. I remember a time when we had to look things up in books from the library!
              <br>
              Getting help from others great, but I think that it is a bit cheeky to ask for help if you haven't actually tried it on your own first!
