              I am at the beginning of a new adventure.  After many years of drifting peacefully along on a gently flowing river, I rounded a bend, and there were rapids ahead!  Too late to make for the bank, there was only the option to ride the rapids and hope to make it to where the river runs gently again.  But for now, I must keep paddling.
              I have chosen to head out to deeper water (turning down a safe and boring job). I am expecting hard work, but an opening up to new ideas, technology and creativity.

              Attending EDA is my new adventure and I intend to learn as much as possible and hopefully enjoy the ride.  I expect it to be challenging, but with challenges come victories and growth.  I am so grateful for this opportunity.  There is an adventure around every bend in the river!
