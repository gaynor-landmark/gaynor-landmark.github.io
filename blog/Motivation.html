              I really identify strongly with the idea that resilience can be learned and built out of every failure.
                When I fail, it is so easy to think about the failure and dwell in the past,
                 wishing I could change what I did or said. It is far more productive to ask for forgiveness,
                  then forgive myself and use the experience to grow.

              <br>
              So many of our battles in life are won or lost on the battlefield of the mind.
                We need to reflect on our successes as much, if not more, than our failures.

              Hmm... I have been thinking just lately about a book I read a while ago called <q>Wild at Heart</q> by John Eldredge.  (It wasn't about Wellington!)  He believes that too many men are bored with life and that every man needs a battle to win, an adventure to live and a maiden to rescue.  In my words - we all need a challenge, an adventure and a purpose in our lives.  That would make us bounce out of bed in the morning!  It need not be just one challenge, one adventure and one purpose, but our days could be filled with many challenges and many purposes and many adventures - all adding up to  a meaningful life - a life that matters.
