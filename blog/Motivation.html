            <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h2>

            <p>  
              In this context, <em>pleasure</em> refers to the happiness you get from transient experiences - the happiness and reward are fleeting. <em>Passion</em> in this context, refers to the happiness achieved when you are performing at your peak and doing something that you love. <em>Purpose</em> is a more sustaining happiness which comes from being part of something that is bigger that yourself - a more altruistic goal. Life with a purpose is what we all deeply desire, although not everyone realises it.  Without a defining purpose, life can be a constant search for meaning.

              As a christian, I guess I stand for truth.  So, my core values would be based on the biblical values of love, peace, obedience and service.

          <div class="ten columns"> 
            <p>  
              I really identified strongly with the idea that resilience can be learned and built out of every failure.  When I fail, it is so easy to think about the failure and dwell in the past, wishing I could change what I did or said. It is  far more productive to ask for forgiveness, then forgive myself and use the experience to grow.  <q>..failure is the building block of success</q>  So many of our battles in  life are won or lost on the battlefield of the mind.  We need to reflect on our successes as much, if not more, than our failures.

              Hmm... I have been thinking just lately about a book I read a while ago called <q>Wild at Heart</q> by John Eldredge.  (It wasn't about Wellington!)  He believes that too many men are bored with life and that every man needs a battle to win, an adventure to live and a maiden to rescue.  In my words - we all need a challenge, an adventure and a purpose in our lives.  That would make us bounce out of bed in the morning!  It need not be just one challenge, one adventure and one purpose, but our days could be filled with many challenges and many purposes and many adventures - all adding up to  a meaningful life - a life that matters.
