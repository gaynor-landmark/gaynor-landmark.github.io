              There are two parts to a web page.  The first is the content ie all the words and the various pictures that illustrate what has been written, in the order in which it will appear on the page. This is created using HTML.  The second is the the design and styling of the page ie the colours that are chosen, the type of fonts and how the content is positioned on the page. This is layered onto the content to give the page its look and feel.
              The page could be thought of as a set of Troika dolls or Russion nesting dolls.  The web page is the whole set displayed together.  The dolls are like elements on a webpage.  Many of the elements contain further elements, just like one doll can have another doll inside it. HTML describes how many dolls there are and which ones are standing on their own and which ones have others inside them.  All their shapes are basically the same, but each can be given a different personality by the CSS that is used to paint it. 

              The DOM is the Document Object Model - a description of how the page will look when it appears on the screen as the CSS and HTML has been interpreted by the browser that is being used.

            <p>
              A design is 'boxified' by separating it out into smaller and smaller boxes so that the design can be translated into HTML elements that will appear on a page.

              The box model is the way that area around the content in an element is described.  The Content is the inner-most box.  This is inside the padding box.  The padding box is inside the border and then that is inside the margin. The boxes around the content can be styled using CSS.
