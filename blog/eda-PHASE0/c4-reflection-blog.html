              This is a very special opportunity for me.  It seemed that the river of my life was flowing along at a very sedate pace, when suddenly, there was a bend in the river, and around that corner were some very unexpected rapids.  I had a choice to either paddle to the side and stay in the shallows or start paddling and face the challenge.  I have chosen to head out to deeper water (turning down a safe and boring job) and start paddling furiously towards the EDA rapids and hopefully a new adventure beyond.

              At this stage, still in Phase-0, I am expecting hard work, but an opening up to new ideas, technology and creativity.

              I feel like I have both a restaurant mindset and a kitchen mindset.  I think that I am investing a lot of money in this course, and expect to get a lot out, but because of that, I am prepared to roll up my sleeves and throw myself into the work.

              I was told it would be a big time commitment, and I still believe it will be, but now I think that the support will also be awesome.
