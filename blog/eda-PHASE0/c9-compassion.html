              To be brutally honest, I think that it is wishful thinking to think that people can become more compassionate just by thinking about goodness.  I think is comes through understanding of another's position and being able to imagine how it would feel to be in that same position.  This is becomes easier as one experiences more of life's 'ups and downs'. It also helps to want to be compassionate.  But becoming compassionate just by thinking about goodness?  I'm sorry, but I am not persuaded. Compassion is a wonderful gift, both for the person who is compassionate, and even more so for the person who is the recipient of compassion. I appreciate that this book has made me more aware of how much compassion is needed in the workplace.

              The SCARF Model describes the areas of life that drive social behaviour. 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Status - is all about the pecking order and how competent you are compared with others around you.  Improving your skills can give you a feeling of improved status compared with yourself. </li>
              <li>Certainty - Uncertainity can occupy so much of your mind that you are incapable of focusing on other things. Increasing cerainty allows you to perform better.</li>
              <li>Autonomy - having some control over your surroundings is very important. Feeling helpless creates stress.</li>
              <li>Relatedness - everyone needs to feel that they have friends and have support against their enemies.</li>
              <li>Fairness - everyone likes to feel that they have been treated fairly.</li>

            <h2>Difficult conversations and mindful emailing (or slacking!) are highly important at EDA. Is there an example in your life where you applied/didn't apply these concepts? How did you feel about it?</h2>

              I have had many difficult conversations through my working and private life.  I know that I have difficulty letting things go when I have been upset, so I have learnt that it is better not to let things stew, but to have the difficult conversation as early as possible.  I have found that people appreciate a direct (but sensitive) approach.  There is nothing worse than finding out months later that you have upset someone, or that people have been talking behind your back.  It's just never easy though, is it?  And then there are always the conversations that blow up in your face, no matter how sensitive you have tried to be!
