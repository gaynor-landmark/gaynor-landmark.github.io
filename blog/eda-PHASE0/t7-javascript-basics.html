            <h2>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="ten columns">
            <p>  
              While HTML supplies the structure and content of a web page, and CSS supplies the styling, positioning and design, Javascript brings power to the page.  It adds the interaction to your page, changing what data is displayed, and possibly retrieving data from a visitor and storing it.  It is the programming language of the browser.
              A creating web page has been likened to creating a person - the HTML supplies the skeleton, head body amd limbs; the CSS provides the clothing for the person to wear and then the Javascript brings life, enabling the person to do things like run, jump and communicate.

          <div class="ten columns"> 
            <p>  
              Control flow is the built in intelligence of the program, making decisions as to what part of the code will be executed. (eg. if... then... else...) Loops allow tasks to be repeated. (eg. do... while...) 
              If I was making a myself a hot drink, the control flow would determine whether to put a teabag or a teaspoon of instant coffee in my cup, depending on whether I decide to have coffee or tea.  I would not put both a teabag and a teaspoon of coffee in my cup.  I would then switch on the jug, and then check to see if the water was boiling.  If it was not boiling, I would wait a while and then check again, and again, and again until the water was boiling and I could make my cuppa.  This recurring behaviour would be handled by a loop in the programming. The loop would start when I swithched the kettle on, and then repeat the wait-check process until the jug had boiled.

            <p>  
              Data is stored in an array when order is important, and the data will be accessed by a numerical index.  Object literals are collections of name-value pairs, used when order is not important.  The data is accessed using the name as the key or index.

            <p>  
              A function is a group of statements in code that for a unit to perform a task.  They are useful as the can be 'called' for other places in the program and used more than once.

            <h2>With an example, explain the differences between 'functional' and 'object oriented' programming</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="ten columns"> 
            <p>  
              Functional programming is based around mathematical functions that are performed on the data passed to the function. If you give a function a 'dog' and a 'tail', it will return a 'wag'. Object-oriented program is based around the structuring of the data in classes to represent objects. These objects have fields/properties that contain data, and they also have methods or behaviour that they perform.  A 'dog' object has a 'tail' (property) and knows how to 'wag' (method).
