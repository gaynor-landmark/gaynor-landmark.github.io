      <h1 class="text-center">Wise Words from Dr James Dobson</h1>
      <div class=trans-box>
        <p>
          When my children were small, busy, and 'boy'-strous, I sometimes felt that I enjoyed them the most when they were fast asleep in bed. I smile to think of their soft eye-lashes resting on their angelic chubby cheeks! Every mum has probably felt that way.
          It was during those years that I often turned to the wise words of Dr James Dobson coming to me accross the radio waves through a Focus on the Family braodcast. My mum lived on the other side of the world and my dad had passed away. I missed
          having grandparents that could drop by and help me with my parenting challenges. Instead, I had James Dobson. Dr. Dobson is a controversial figure for  many reasons, but his child-rearing advice was invaluable to me.  I felt I came to know him well - his voice was gentle and his practical advice so helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I read a number of his books. 'The Strong-Willed Child' and 'Dare to Discipline' were particularly helpful to me. I know that some might be horrified by his suggestions, but his encouragement to put boundaries in place for my boys, and have consequences
          for stepping outside them, made family-life so much better! I had two confident happy little boys, full of life and adventure. (Note that I did not say perfect!) </p>
        <p>
          I am now the mum of 2 amazing young men. One has a degree in Music and is currently studying towards his teaching qualification and the other is a Mechanical Engineer, working on his Masters in International Automotive Engineering. More than that, they
          are loving and caring young men who know how to work hard and balance that with enjoying life too. The hard work in the early years has so paid off. My thanks to Dr Dobson so his help and advice when I needed it most. </p>
        <p>
          You can read more <em>about</em> him on Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dobson">here</a>), but if you really want to get to <em>know</em> him and learn from him, you can head over to the website for the organisation he
          founded, <span id=fotf>Focus on the Family</span> (www.focusonthefamily.com), or listen to him on
