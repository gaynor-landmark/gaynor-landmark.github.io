                      I completed my study at Enspiral Dev Academy in Wellington at the beginning of April.
                      This is the final project created by a group of 5 students, of which I was one.

                      The idea is to assist anyone who is unable to afford the dental treatment they need, with crowd-funding.
                      They could post their story and a picture of their teeth, in the hope that generous donors
                      would contribute to their dentalcare.

                      In the just under a week, we designed and built this app. We used React.js, which meant that we were all able to work on separate components and then slot them together as they were completed.
                      We tested using Mocha, Chai, Enzyme and Nightwatch, and used Github to manage workflow.
